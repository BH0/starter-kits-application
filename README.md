# Starter-Kits
# Starter Kits Application

## About 
An application made using various tools and demonstrating various skills I've picked up over the past few months most notably server-side programming using the Model-View-Controller framework Express. 

## Application's Purpose 
With various web-development tools such as React, Angular, Wordpress (theme / plugin development) etcetera; it can often be a pain just getting started - this application hopes to reduce that pain by encouraging the sharing of projects which I nickname "starter-kits", these projects can be anything from CLI tools (such as Create-React-App), to simple files with some boilerplate code which are intended to save their appropriate audience's time and effort. 

Designed and developed as a companion application for Github; don't worry about needing to make yet another account to something you might only use now and then, simply use your pre-existing Github account and find + share projects in no time thus helping the community (and making a name for yourself) in the process.
